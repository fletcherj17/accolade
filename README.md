# User Story

Accolade is a place for creatives to find out what's going on, and to get the help they need to complete projects. 

Creatives can post their upcoming performances, showcases, or premieres in on the site, to spread the word. They can also post an ad looking for actors, models, photographers, or videographers, and more.

Users will click the menu bar at the top to log in or sign up. From there they will have the option see the pages where all the events and listings are. They can add more posts on these pages, if needed. 

I want to use Google Maps or a similar map api to display event locations.
